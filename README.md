Prettier Playground
===================

Come play with prettier!

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. Run `nvm use` to set your Node version to 10 (if using `nvm`)
3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies

## Usage

Feel free to play around with the `.prettierrc` config in the root.

Run `yarn prettier` to prettify all the `js` and `jsx` files inside of `src`.

If you want to test out the `git-hooks`, make some changes, and then do `git commit -am "your message"` and see the git hook in action!
